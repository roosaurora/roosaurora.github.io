We analysed 38 responses to the online survey and ran a\n            statistical analysis on RStudio regarding significant factors.\n          </b>{\" \"}\n          Afterwards, we received a positive response after contacting the CEO,\n          the head of engineering and the head of product at Vinted and were\n          encouraged to keep working on the platform.\n        </p>\n        <h4>Critical indicent technique</h4>\n        <p>\n          Something I took away from my year at Université Paris-Saclay (ranked\n          14th globally in the {\"\"}\n          <a\n            href=\"http://www.shanghairanking.com/ARWU2020.html\"\n            target=\"_blank\"\n            rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\n          >\n            Academic Ranking of World Universities 2020\n          </a>\n          ) was the step between having an idea what to make and to whom, and\n          zooming into how to design it – kind of like the situation I had at\n          Nokia. I now often ask the user to describe, in as much detail as\n          possible, issues they faced and how they resolved them while\n          interacting with a specific interface. When designing{\" \"}\n          <a\n            href=\"https://youtu.be/sY-TQH038Ow\"\n            target=\"_blank\"\n            rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\n          >\n            AccessMap\n          </a>\n          , a navigation app optimizing the most accessible routes, the\n          interface I asked about was a competitive solution, whereas with{\" \"}\n          <a\n            href=\"https://youtu.be/u9Wl1EfpF7o\"\n            target=\"_blank\"\n            rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\n          >\n            Part Planner\n          </a>\n          , a collaborative party planner application and{\" \"}\n          <a\n            href=\"https://youtu.be/hbIsv9WGnyE\"\n            target=\"_blank\"\n            rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\n          >\n            Squatle\n          </a>\n          , a service for booking sports classes, this technique was also used with\n          the previous version to the one we were working on. Each time it\n          pinpointed the focus points of the following prototype, resulting in\n          an improved design.\n        </p>\n        <h4>Observation (and documentation)</h4>\n        <p>\n          Sometimes you need to hit the field (or create one) to acquire\n          knowledge beyond words – I noticed this when designing digital\n          interfaces for live musicians. As my thesis project, I designed a\n          collaborative interface for adjusting digital audio effects of four\n          instruments simultaneously in real-time. The participatory design\n          process started by organizing workshops, where the musicians were\n          instructed to perform different improvisation tasks to identify the\n          main opportunities and challenges of digital audio effects in\n          improvised live music. By socially engineering a real situation, more\n          targeted and valuable observations about the use case could be\n          vocalized and documented during the group discussions that followed.\n          Regardless, I noticed that not everything valuable was mentioned\n          during the discussions. Recording things said out loud while\n          performing a task is crucial to me and in fact, I encourage users to\n          speak up during the interaction with a system or a prototype as much\n          as possible.{\" \"}\n        </p>\n        <h4>Personas and scenarios</h4>\n        <p>\n          Moving on to the analysis part of all the valuable knowledge acquired\n          with the above techniques: constructing user personas and scenarios.\n          I've noticed that this part might not be taken seriously, even though\n          it beautifully merges a lot of intrinsic knowledge in a motivating and\n          easy-to-grasp way for the whole team.\n        </p>\n      </div>\n    );\n  }\n}\n"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
