BFAT3 was a test automation solution me and my team at Nokia\n          built from scratch and released on time during a year between 2017 and\n          2018. It was implemented with React, Node.js and MongoDB.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          I learned a great deal about software architecture: the ways in which\n          the GUI connects to and is, in fact, defined by the many data\n          structures which go beyond callbacks on the server side. On the other\n          hand, I finally and fully realized how the GUI creates a user\n          experience and how immensely useful a design system (a customized\n          bootstrap library) was with the lack of a graphic designer next to me.{\" \"}\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          I programmed the frontend and backend for a modular table-based UI and\n          the interactions with the results of the software. Since then, I've\n          come to realize that also other companies benefit from interactive\n          tables which structure and modify data from several databases. I'm\n          grateful to have digged deep into the topic and after learning about\n          usability heuristics would indeed like to continue my work with the\n          table design.{\" \"}\n        </p>\n        <h5>Hands and omens</h5>\n        <p>\n          Since people tend to remember the first website they build as a\n          passion project, here's my exploration with minimalist and visual web\n          design which I did for my sister's band. They have updated the webpage\n          since, but hey, I've come a long way too.{\" \"}\n        </p>\n        <img src={require(\"./images/ho.jpg\")} alt=\"Ho\" className=\"Image full\" />\n        <h4>Mobile development</h4>\n        <img\n          src={require(\"./images/cocat schema.png\")}\n          alt=\"Cocat schema\"\n          className=\"Image full left\"\n        />\n        <img\n          src={require(\"./images/cocat features .png\")}\n          alt=\"Cocat features\"\n          className=\"Image full right\"\n        />\n        <p>\n          The co-catering app already mentioned on this web page didn't end with\n          the first mockup. Our team designed and implemented the Co-cat web app\n          and finally an Android mobile web service with React Native. During\n          the project we learned how to integrate design principles into the\n          software development process by turning findings from user research\n          into dev-friendly schemas.\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n          Regarding the design, this project highlighted that{\" \"}\n          <b> the screen size matters</b> and that the mobile environment\n          shouldn't be overlooked as something simple and boring. Redesigning\n          the same set of features taught me that{\" \"}\n          <b>\n            the scenarios of use may change the same as the UI when switching to\n            mobile\n          </b>\n          . Thanks to reading about the theory of mobile design, I also got some\n          useful principles up my sleeve.{\" \"}\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          User evaluation played a huge role throughout the project, so after\n          the initial field study we did for the proof of concept, we collected\n          feedback both remotely and in person for four different versions of\n          the app. You can read more about this in the next section.{\" \"}\n        </p>\n      </div>\n    );\n  }\n}\n"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
