Each time it\n          pinpointed the focus points of the following prototype and resulted in\n          an improved design.\n        </p>\n        <h4>Observation (and documentation)</h4>\n        <p>\n          <img\n            src={require(\"./images/jamming.png\")}\n            alt=\"Digital jamming\"\n            className=\"Image medium right\"\n          />\n          When designing a digital interface for live musicians, I noticed that\n          sometimes you need to hit the field (or create one) to acquire\n          knowledge. As my thesis project, I designed a collaborative interface\n          for adjusting digital audio effects of four instruments simultaneously\n          in real-time. The participatory design process started by organizing\n          workshops, where the musicians were instructed to perform different\n          improvisation tasks to identify the main opportunities and challenges\n          of digital audio effects in improvised live music. By socially\n          engineering a real situation, more targeted and valuable observations\n          about the use case could be vocalized and documented during the group\n          discussions that followed. However, not everything valuable was\n          mentioned during these discussions. Recording things said out loud\n          while performing a task was crucial and I encourage users to speak up\n          during the interaction with a system or a prototype as much as\n          possible.{\" \"}\n        </p>\n        <h4>Personas and scenarios</h4>\n        <p>\n          I'll mention one thing regarding what to do with all the useful things\n          learned about the users: constructing user personas and scenarios.\n          I've noticed that this part might not be taken as seriously as it\n          should, even though it beautifully merges together a lot of intrinsic\n          knowledge in a motivating and easy-to-grasp way for the whole team.\n          Deducing a somewhat detailed story about what type of personas are\n          going to use a product and in which situations tremendously helps\n          communication, because as a team member you can use those to justify\n          comments regarding features, layout, look and feel.\n        </p>\n        <div className=\"Image-row\"></div>\n      </div>\n    );\n  }\n}\n"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
