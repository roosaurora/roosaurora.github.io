Thanks to AI, Weather to Wear matched personalized suggestions on what to wear or pack for a trip with the weather conditions and based on statistics, could idenfiy which clothing items the user could get rid of or get from other users with the touch of a button. Thanks to a market research and an additional online survey, we could shape our business-worthy design and to identify our first users.

The owners (be it\n                a city, an organization or an individual) of green areas could\n                find gardeners to maintain or to fully design it, responding to\n                the needs of those living in a small city flat with a longing\n                for gardening and significantly reducing the costs of keeping\n                public spaces attractive. Reaching out to prospective users such\n                as young adults and the city of Stockholm proved that the values\n                of the platform well represented those of the company: mental\n                health, community and a positive environmental impact. What's\n                more, we could attract even more inexperienced city gardeners\n                with helpful information e.g. notifications on when to water\n                plants, enabled by smart humidity sensors provided by the case\n                owner.\n              </p>\n              <img src=\"./images/oasis_mockup.png\" alt=\"Oasis mockup\"></img>\n              <img\n                src=\"./images/oasis_planting.png\"\n                alt=\"Oasis planting\"\n                width=\"500\"\n              ></img>\n              <img\n                src=\"./images/techfest.jpeg\"\n                alt=\"Oasis presentation\"\n                width=\"200\"\n              ></img>\n              <p>\n                Another success was the development of \"Weather to Wear\", a web\n                application for digitizing one's wardrobe. The environmental\n                impact of the garment industry (20% of all water pollution)\n                could be battled with a C2C business model integrated with an\n                existing clothes-swapping platform, Vinted, with more than 1.5\n                million active daily users in France. Thanks to AI, Weather to\n                Wear matched personalized suggestions on what to wear or pack\n                for a trip with the weather conditions and based on statistics,\n                could idenfiy which clothing items the user could get rid of or\n                get from other users with the touch of a button. Thanks to a\n                market research and an additional online survey, we could shape\n                our business-worthy design and to identify our first users. We\n                analysed 38 responses to the online survey and ran a statistical\n                analysis in R studio regarding significant factors. We received\n                a positive response after contacting the CEO, the head of\n                engineering and the head of product at Vinted and were\n                encouraged to keep on working on the platform.\n              </p>\n              <h4>Critical indicent technique</h4>\n              <p>\n                This is something I took away from my studies at Université\n                Paris-Saclay (ranked 14th globally in the\n                <a href=\"http://www.shanghairanking.com/ARWU2020.html\">\n                  Academic Ranking of World Universities 2020\n                </a>\n                ). Let's say you have an idea ready but you want to zoom into\n                how to design it – kind of like the situation we had at Nokia.\n                You need to ask the user to describe, in as much detail as\n                possible, what issues they face and how they resolve them when\n                using a specific interface. A protip is to choose a competitive\n                solution to the one you're working on. This will pinpoint at\n                least some of the focus points of the following design. I've\n                used it when designing AccessMap, a navigation app optimizing\n                the most accessible routes, Part Planner, a collaborative party\n                planner application and Squatle, a service for booking sports\n                classes.\n              </p>\n            </div>\n          }\n        />\n        <ContentParallax\n          name=\"Ideate\"\n          scratch=\"Pretty and kind for all project members to alleviate working\"\n          fixed=\"Pretty holistic and kind of necessary for all project members to\n              enjoy working\"\n        />\n        <PageContent\n          id=\"ideate\"\n          title=\"Developing ideas\"\n          content={\n            <p>\n              {\" \"}\n              Yubikiri yakusoku Hikaru ichiban boshi Atashi no subete de Anata\n              wo uketomeru Matsu koto wa mou nai no Kon'ya anata wo tsuredasu\n              Dou suru?
