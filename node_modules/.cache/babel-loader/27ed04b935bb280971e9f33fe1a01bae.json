As my first task, I drafted an\n          online survey based on experience gained during business development\n          labs at the EIT Digital master school.{\" \"}\n          <b>\n            The study eventually reached 445 volunteer beta testers and helped\n            our developer team to prioritize features, me to realize how they\n            should be implemented and the CFO, who found the results \"extremely\n            valuable\", with the pricing of the product.\n          </b>\n        </p>\n        <h5>Oasis</h5>\n        <p>\n          <img\n            src={require(\"./images/oasis_mockup.png\")}\n            alt=\"Oasis mockup\"\n            className=\"Image small right\"\n          />\n          To win the Sthlm Tech Fest 2019 Husqvarna and Capgemini challenge, our\n          team developed a platform, Oasis, which enabled collectively sharing\n          and building green areas in the urban environment. The owners (a city,\n          an organization or an individual) of green areas could find gardeners\n          to maintain or to fully design it, responding to the needs of those\n          living in a small city flat with a longing for gardening and\n          significantly reducing the costs of keeping public spaces attractive.\n          <b>\n            {\" \"}\n            Reaching out to young adults and the city of Stockholm proved that\n            the value provided by the platform well represented those behind the\n            business challenge: well-being, community and both environmental and\n            financial sustainability.\n          </b>{\" \"}\n          As the secret (usability) sauce, Oasis attracted inexperienced city\n          gardeners with automated notifications about plant watering, enabled\n          by the smart humidity sensors provided by the case owner.\n        </p>\n        <h5>Weather to wear</h5>\n        <p>\n          <img\n            src={require(\"./images/technosocial.png\")}\n            alt=\"Wtw\"\n            className=\"Image full left\"\n          />\n          Another success was the development of \"Weather to Wear\", a web\n          application for digitizing one's wardrobe. The environmental impact of\n          the garment industry (20% of all water pollution) could be battled\n          with a C2C business model integrated with an existing clothes-swapping\n          platform, Vinted, with more than 1.5 million active daily users in\n          France. Thanks to AI, W2W matched personalized suggestions on what to\n          wear or pack for a trip with the weather conditions. Based on\n          statistics, it could identify which clothing items the user could get\n          rid of or get from other users with the touch of a button.\n          <b>\n            {\" \"}\n            Thanks to a market research and an additional online survey, we\n            could shape our business-worthy design and to identify our first\n            users.

As my thesis project, I designed a collaborative interface\n          for adjusting digital audio effects of four instruments simultaneously\n          in real-time. The participatory design process started by organizing\n          workshops, where the musicians were instructed to perform different\n          improvisation tasks to identify the main opportunities and challenges\n          of digital audio effects in improvised live music.{\" \"}\n          <b>\n            By socially engineering a real situation, more targeted and valuable\n            observations about the use case could be vocalized and documented\n            during the group discussions that followed\n          </b>\n          .

Deducing a\n          somewhat detailed story about what type of personas are going to use a\n          product – and in which situations – helps communication, because as a\n          team member you can use those to justify comments regarding features,\n          layout, look and feel.
