Once prospective,\n                active or past users have been reached, getting to know them\n                personally, statistically and as the users of your product is\n                everything. I've conducted questionnaires to validate businesses\n                during case winning hackathon projects and best graded\n                university courses. During The Sthlm Tech Fest 2019 we developed\n                a platform, Oasis, which enabled collectively sharing and\n                building green areas in the urban environment. The owners (be it\n                a city, an organization or an individual) of green areas could\n                find gardeners to maintain or to fully design it, responding to\n                the needs of those living in a small city flat with a longing\n                for gardening and significantly reducing the costs of keeping\n                public spaces attractive. Reaching out to prospective users such\n                as young adults and the city of Stockholm proved that the values\n                of the platform well represented those of the company: mental\n                health, community and a positive environmental impact. What's\n                more, we could attract even more inexperienced city gardeners\n                with helpful information e.g. notifications on when to water\n                plants, enabled by smart humidity sensors provided by the case\n                owner.\n              </p>\n              <img src=\"./images/oasis_mockup.png\" alt=\"Oasis mockup\"></img>\n              <img\n                src=\"./images/oasis_planting.png\"\n                alt=\"Oasis planting\"\n                width=\"500\"\n              ></img>\n              <img\n                src=\"./images/techfest.jpeg\"\n                alt=\"Oasis presentation\"\n                width=\"200\"\n              ></img>\n              <p>\n                Another success was the development of \"Weather to Wear\", a web\n                application for digitizing one's wardrobe. The environmental\n                impact of the garment industry (20% of all water pollution)\n                could be battled with a C2C business model integrated with an\n                existing clothes-swapping platform, Vinted, with more than 1.5\n                million active daily users in France. Thanks to AI, Weather to\n                Wear matched personalized suggestions on what to wear or pack\n                for a trip with the weather conditions and based on statistics,\n                could identify which clothing items the user could get rid of or\n                get from other users with the touch of a button. Thanks to a\n                market research and an additional online survey, we could shape\n                our business-worthy design and to identify our first users. We\n                analysed 38 responses to the online survey and ran a statistical\n                analysis in R studio regarding significant factors. We received\n                a positive response after contacting the CEO, the head of\n                engineering and the head of product at Vinted and were\n                encouraged to keep on working on the platform.\n              </p>\n              <h4>Critical indicent technique</h4>\n              <p>\n                This is something I took away from my studies at Université\n                Paris-Saclay (ranked 14th globally in the {\"\"}\n                <a href=\"http://www.shanghairanking.com/ARWU2020.html\">\n                  Academic Ranking of World Universities 2020\n                </a>\n                ). Let's say you have an idea what to make and to whom, but you\n                need to zoom into how to design it – kind of like the situation\n                we had at Nokia. You need to ask the user to describe, in as\n                much detail as possible, issues they faced and how they resolved\n                them when using a specific interface. A protip is to choose a\n                competitive solution or a previous version to the one you're\n                working on, which will pinpoint at least some of the focus\n                points of the following design. I've used it when designing\n                AccessMap, a navigation app optimizing the most accessible\n                routes, Part Planner, a collaborative party planner application\n                and Squatle, a service for booking sports classes to name a few.\n              </p>\n              <h4>Observation (and group interviews)</h4>\n              <p>\n                Sometimes you need to hit the field (or create one) to acquire\n                knowledge beyond words – I noticed this when designing digital\n                interfaces for live musicians. As my thesis project, I designed\n                a collaborative interface for adjusting digital audio effects of\n                four instruments simultaneously in real-time. The participatory\n                design process started by organizing workshops, where the\n                musicians were instructed to perform different improvisation\n                tasks to identify the main opportunities and challenges of\n                digital audio effects in improvised live music. By socially\n                engineering a real situation, more targeted and valuable\n                observations about the use case could be vocalized and\n                documented during the group discussions that followed.{\" \"}\n              </p>\n              <h4>Personas and scenarios</h4>\n              <p>\n                Moving on to the analysis part of all the valuable knowledge\n                aqcuired with the above techniques: constructing user personas\n                and scenarios. I've noticed that this part might not be taken\n                seriously, even though it beautifully merges a lot of intrinsic\n                knowledge in a motivating and easy-to-grasp way for the whole\n                team.\n              </p>\n            </div>\n          }\n        />\n        <ContentParallax\n          name=\"Ideate\"\n          scratch=\"Pretty and kind for all project members to alleviate working\"\n          fixed=\"Pretty holistic and kind of necessary for all project members to\n              enjoy working\"\n        />\n        <PageContent\n          id=\"ideate\"\n          title=\"Developing ideas\"\n          content={\n            <p>\n              {\" \"}\n              Yubikiri yakusoku Hikaru ichiban boshi Atashi no subete de Anata\n              wo uketomeru Matsu koto wa mou nai no Kon'ya anata wo tsuredasu\n              Dou suru?
